# Installation 
To setup the necessary virtual env, run `scripts/setup.sh` from the root directory of the repository. Then, to start up the virtual environment, run `scripts/start.sh`
Both scripts are written for use in a HPC environment and assume the presence of an environment variable `$FLUSHDIR` that holds the path to an appropriate installation directory for the virtual env.
